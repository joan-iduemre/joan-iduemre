# My Programming Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Joan Iduemre, a newbie in the world of programming and aspiring to break into the tech industry. Here, I document my learning process and showcase my projects as I embark on this exciting journey.

## About Me
I am passionate about technology and its potential to make a positive impact on people's lives. With a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of programming, I am dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in various programming languages and frameworks.

## Goals
- **Learning Frontend Development:** My primary focus is on frontend development, where I aim to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and interactive web interfaces. I'm also eager to delve into modern frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## Collaboration and Learning
I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and peer-to-peer learning. I am open to collaborating with other developers, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging in meaningful discussions. Together, we can support and inspire each other as we progress in our programming journeys.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. [Formify](https://joan-iduemre.github.io/formify)
   - Repository: [joan-iduemre/formify](https://github.com/joan-iduemre/formify)
   - Description: Formify is a simple signup form page that serves as a practical project for learning HTML, CSS, and familiarizing oneself with the fundamental concepts of Git and GitHub. Through this repository, I gained valuable hands-on experience in version control, repository management, and collaboration techniques using Git and GitHub. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to explore the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Pages.

By working on Formify, I deepened my understanding of web development, acquired essential skills in using HTML and CSS, and practiced using Git and GitHub effectively. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, fostering a practical and comprehensive learning experience.

2. [Cat App](https://joan-iduemre.github.io/cat-app)
   - Repository: [joan-iduemre/cat-app](https://github.com/joan-iduemre/cat-app)
   - Description: The Cat-App repository is a project that showcases a simple HTML page featuring cat photos, lists, and a submission form. The purpose of this project is to provide an interactive experience for users to explore cat-related content. Users can browse a gallery of cat photos and click on the provided link to see more. Two lists are includedâ€”one showcasing things that cats love and the other highlighting the top three things cats hate. Users can also fill out a form to submit their own cat photo, specifying whether their cat is indoor or outdoor and indicating the cat's personality.
   

I will be sharing more projects as time goes to demonstrate my growth and showcase my skills. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, and suggest improvements. Let's learn and grow together!

3. [Cafe Menu](https://joan-iduemre.github.io/cafe-menu)
   - Repository: [joan-iduemre/cafe-menu](https://github.com/joan-iduemre/cafe-menu)
   - Description: The Cafe Menu project is a simple HTML code that showcases a cafe menu with various coffee options and their corresponding prices. By exploring and working on this project, I have gained a better understanding of HTML and its elements. Through writing and structuring the HTML code for the cafe menu, I have learned how to create headings, lists, and sections to organize the content effectively. Additionally, I have practiced using HTML tags to display text, images, and links within the menu. This project has served as a hands-on experience that has deepened my knowledge and proficiency in HTML.

Working on the Cafe Menu project has provided me with practical experience in web development using HTML. It has allowed me to apply the concepts and techniques learned in HTML to a real-world scenario. By customizing and modifying the code, I have enhanced my skills in HTML syntax, element manipulation, and styling. This project has been instrumental in honing my HTML abilities and has contributed significantly to my growth as a web developer.
