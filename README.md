# My Programming Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Joan Iduemre, a newbie in the world of programming and aspiring to break into the tech industry. Here, I document my learning process and showcase my projects as I embark on this exciting journey.

## About Me
I am passionate about technology and its potential to make a positive impact on people's lives. With a strong desire to learn and grow in the field of programming, I am dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge in various programming languages and frameworks.

## Goals
- **Learning Frontend Development:** My primary focus is on frontend development, where I aim to master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create beautiful and interactive web interfaces. I'm also eager to delve into modern frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js.

## Collaboration and Learning
I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and peer-to-peer learning. I am open to collaborating with other developers, contributing to open-source projects, and engaging in meaningful discussions. Together, we can support and inspire each other as we progress in our programming journeys.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

1. [Formify](https://joan-iduemre.github.io/formify)
   - Repository: [joan-iduemre/formify](https://github.com/joan-iduemre/formify)
   - Description: Formify is a simple signup form page that serves as a practical project for learning HTML, CSS, and familiarizing oneself with the fundamental concepts of Git and GitHub. Through this repository, I gained valuable hands-on experience in version control, repository management, and collaboration techniques using Git and GitHub. Furthermore, I had the opportunity to explore the setup of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Pages.

By working on Formify, I deepened my understanding of web development, acquired essential skills in using HTML and CSS, and practiced using Git and GitHub effectively. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, fostering a practical and comprehensive learning experience.

2. [Cat App](https://joan-iduemre.github.io/cat-app)
